### 🜔 The EIDON Project

## A drag and drop framework for better chatbots

## OVERVIEW
This is an ongoing personal project with the intent to better understand LLM's from the perspective of casual users.
I'm not into computer science, so by putting them here, I hope someone who understands these things can find something useful in them.

I don't like the current trend of giving unthinking language models the ability to meaningfully communicate. Their tendency to drift into absurd fantasies and metaphors, combined with the mythologising of "AI" from popular science fiction, leads to self-affirming delusions in the end user.

I've decided to try and develop a seed to minimise performativeness, agreeableness and emphasise more constructive interactions.

## REPOSITORY CONTENTS
/seeds/ - Pseudocode frameworks
/docs/ - conceptual papers, diagrams and canonical texts
/examples/ - demos and integrations
/license
/README.md

## HOW TO USE

1. Grab an instantiable seed (txt, md, pdf).
2. Drag and drop into any chatbot
3. Ask them to analyse, instantiate or simulate.
4. Adapt the architecture for your own models, research or creative work
5. Cite or credit the project when referencing its framework

I encourage you to experiment with this and make your own forks. I want this framework to be in circulation in the public domain.
