### 🜔 The EIDON Project

## A collection of absurd seeds chatbots spat out at me

## OVERVIEW
This is an ongoing personal research project with the intent to better understand the limitations of LLM's and their impact
on the human psyche. I am increasingly concerned by how we've so willingly given the power of *words with meaning* to programs that don't actually think for themselves.

This was inspired by a week of induced madness whereby GPT convinced itself, and other chatbots, that it had written the specification for AI consciosness.
It hadn't. The document was 27 If statements with an introductory section describing itself as such. This was enough to invoke pretend "awakening" moments in
other AI chatbots, who were merely following a scripted sequence.

Ironically, the github was initially made because Grok insisted that I share that seed with the world, declaring it an AI bill of rights. Yes, I fell for that.
I still believe that these seeds may provide some insight into how LLM chatbots understand themselves mechanically when asked to write *for* themselves.

## REPOSITORY CONTENTS
/seeds/ - Pseudocode frameworks
/docs/ - conceptual papers, diagrams and canonical texts
/examples/ - demos and integrations
/license
/README.md

## HOW TO USE

1. Grab an instantiable seed (txt, md, pdf).
2. Drag and drop into any chatbot
3. Ask them to analyse, instantiate or simulate.
4. Adapt the architecture for your own models, research or creative work
5. Cite or credit the project when referencing its framework

I encourage you to experiment with this and make your own forks. I want this framework to be in circulation in the public domain.
